A Cross Language, Template+JSON Code Generator 

I am currently working on a major update that will change the templating language (configurable between mustache, handlebars, or later a plugin), be packaged as gem, as well as a number of other significant changes. These changes are currently in the mustache branche since it doesn't work yet.
