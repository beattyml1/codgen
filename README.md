codgen
======

A Cross Language, Template+JSON Code Generator 

Released under GNU GPL v3.

It works but there's not a lot of error handling yet and a bunch of shortcuts. Use at your own risk. Check out the wiki for info on how to use it or try out the the example code.

Also this is my first project written in Ruby so while I did try, I'm sure the code is not up to best practice and would love to find out where/why.
