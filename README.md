Note that this project is still fairly young so there maybe some bugs and poor error handling here and there. I would love it if you could report them. If I can I'll try to get to them in a day or so.

Also this is my first project written in Ruby so while I did try, I'm sure the code some parts that aren't best practice and would love to find out where/why.
