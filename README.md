codgen
======

A Cross Language, Template+JSON Code Generator 

Released under GNU GPL v3.

It works but there's not a lot of error handling yet and a bunch of shortcuts. Use at your own risk. Check out the wiki for info on how to use it or try out the the example code.

> ruby ../Source/codgen.rb ExampleData.json ExampleTemplate.cs Output.cs Map.json

Also this is my first project written in Ruby so while I did try, I'm sure the code is not up to best practice and would love to find out where/why.
